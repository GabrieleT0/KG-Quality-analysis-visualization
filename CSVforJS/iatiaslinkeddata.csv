For more information see: http://iati2lod.appspot.comIt is widely recognized that the effectiveness of aid can be improved by providing transparant insight into aid activities. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)- a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to improve the transparency of aid- has developed an open standard for the publication of aid information. As of 2013- over 150 donors- NGOs and governments have registered to the IATI registry for publishing their aid activities in this XML standard. Based on the IATI data- we have created a Linked Data model and converted the open data to Linked Data. In order to show the added benefits of Linked Data- we have linked the IATI dataset to various other datasets such as World Bank indicators and DBPedia information. Finally- we have created several applications which combine the information from the IATI dataset and the datasets it was linked to. As a result- we have shown that creating Linked Data for the IATI dataset and linking it to other datasets give new valuable insights in aid transparency.
