Our approach is language independent and easy to be applied to other languages where Wikipedia and DBpedia provided. Our corpus which called KAIST silver standard corpus- includes 6-796-274 sentences and 9-522-298 NEs. NE domain is now focus on just PER- ORG- and LOC. But we are now trying to build DBpedia ontology granularity NE corpus as a future work.
