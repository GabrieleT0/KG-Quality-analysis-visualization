This allows for a consistent coding of news metadata over the course of time - that's the reason why we call them IPTC NewsCodes.The universe of NewsCodes is currently split into many different sets - taxonomies - for increased manageability as topics usually relate to a specific area. A taxonomy is also likely to be used exclusively in a specific metadata property of a news exchange format.To provide an easy overview of our taxonomies further we grouped them into four main areas:* Descriptive NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies to describe the content of news items properly.* Administrative NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies for proper administration of news items.* Transmission NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies with controlled values for the transmission process.* Exchange Format NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies with values to support specific functionalities of the different IPTC news exchange format standards.
