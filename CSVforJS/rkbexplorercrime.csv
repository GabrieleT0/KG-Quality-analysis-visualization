2022-07-18,0,0,UK Open Government Licence (OGL) - uk-ogl -,-,Street level crime reports for England and Wales,The data presented here is a linked data representation of the street-level crime reports first released for England and Wales in 2011.Initial data exports cover December 2010- with monthly updates added when available- usually released one to two months in arrears.Entries exist for each individual crime report. These have been enriched by linking to the nearest postcode for the position at which the crime was reported- which hooks you into the Ordnance Survey administrative geography dataset.In addition- aggregate statistics have been computed for each crime type at Ward- County and European Region level. These include not only cumulative values for these regions- appropriately identified in the OS dataset- but also include densities by area and population. These statistics are extensively used in the See UK application.,http://crime.rkbexplorer.com/,True,1.0,1,0,0.001,-,7780271,rkbexplorercrime,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://crime.rkbexplorer.com/sparql/,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,0.00019349845427940615,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:http://crime.rkbexplorer.com/ Name:Ian Millard Email:Absent,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0.09,684394,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,True,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.354,44.74,-,-,endpoint offline
