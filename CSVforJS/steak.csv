To accomplish this goal- semantic text mining techniques and resource convergence techniques which extract meaningful data from big data resources are implemented as fundamental functions. Moreover- in order to give data readability- an intelligent interface including concept navigation and visualization is additionally provided. The main processes of the STEAK are collecting multilingual lexical resources- extracting patterns appropriate for the resources- explicitly constructing semantic relations- and expressing these outcomes based on SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) type for information sharing and reusability.,http://steak.kisti.re.kr/steak/project.html,False,0.75,[],{},nan,-,333714,steak,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,endpoint absent,Name: Mi-Nyeong Hwang; Email:mnhwang@kisti.re.kr,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://steak.kisti.re.kr/steak/project.html Name:Do-Heon Jeong Email:heon@kisti.re.kr,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.00,0,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.337,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
