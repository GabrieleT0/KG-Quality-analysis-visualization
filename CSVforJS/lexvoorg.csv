2022-07-18,-1,0,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike - cc-by-sa -,-,Lexvo.org,Lexvo.org brings information about languages- words- characters- and other human language-related entities to the Linked Data Web and Semantic Web. The Linked Data Web is a worldwide initiative to create a Web of Data that exposes the relationships between entities in our world. Lexvo.org adds a new perspective to this Web by exposing how everything in our world is connected in terms of language- e.g. by considering semantic relationships between multilingual labels (like book or New York). Lexvo not only defines global IDs (URIs) for language-related objects- but also ensures that these identifiers are dereferenceable and highly interconnected as well as externally linked to a variety of resources on the Web. ,http://www.lexvo.org/,False,0.75,2,1.000,0.001,-,1000000,lexvoorg,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,8.270247859938955e-05,endpoint absent,Name: Gerard de Melo; Email:None,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://www.lexvo.org/ Name:Gerard de Melo Email:Absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.01,8726,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.388,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent
