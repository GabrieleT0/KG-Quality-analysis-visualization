2022-07-18,-1,1,http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/gfdl,-,FamilyRelations as SocialRole,The FRSR vocabulary contains terms useful for finding out more about social roles of a family relation. The approach taken is to describe roles of a person in a society in which he/she is living. this roles could be a father- mother-son or daughter.  These social roles are different from occupational roles. these roles are based on relations. Another purpose of this vocabulary is to show the metamodeling feature through punning.
