2022-07-31,-1,0,Other (Open) - other-open -,-,Suggested Ontology for Pharmacogenomics,SO-Pharm (Suggested Ontology for Pharmacogenomics) is a domain ontology implemented in OWL-DL- which proposes a formal description of pharmacogenomic knowledge. SO-Pharm articulates different ontologies that represent complementary sub-domains of pharmacogenomics- i.e. related to genotype- phenotype- drugs- and clinical trials. SO-Pharm enables to represent pharmacogenomic relationships between a drug- a genomic variation and a phenotype trait. In addition- it enables to represent patient and more largely panel included in trials- and populations. SO-Pharm enables the representation of measured items on this patients such as results from the observation of a phenotype trait or of genomic variations. SO-Pharm supports knowledge about pharmacogenomic hypothesis- case study- and investigations in pharmacogenomics. SO-Pharm is designed to facilitate data integration and knowledge discovery in pharmacogenomics.
