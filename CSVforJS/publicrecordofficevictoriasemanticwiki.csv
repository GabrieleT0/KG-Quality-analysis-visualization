We hold approximately 100kms of records from the mid 1830s to today- which we manage for use by the Government and people of Victoria.The Collection includes memories of events and decisions great and small that have shaped the history of the Colony and State of Victoria- as well as records of immigration and shipping- criminal trials and prisons- premiers and governors- royal commissions- boards of inquiry- wills and probates and more.PROV has in recent months taken the decision to migrate content from its online exhibitions and other sources to the PROV wiki (now a semantic wiki!) The wiki is fast becoming a digital repository and a metadata database that can be queried both internally and externally. Over the coming months PROV will be adding functionality to the wiki that will allow users to:1)Transcribe primary records 2)Geo-reference historic maps 3)Tag content 4)Easily share contentTo convert this dataset to other formats such as html- json- n-triples- turtle etc visit http://morph.talis.com/ and enter http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/rdf/Public_Record_Office_Victoria_Semantic_Wiki.rdf in the Data-URI field.If you have any questions about this dataset or would like to share with us ways in which you have used it please let us know at provonline(at)gmail.com,http://www.wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/Public_Record_Office_Victoria_Semantic_Wiki,absent,0.75,[],{},nan,-,0,publicrecordofficevictoriasemanticwiki,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://www.sparql.org/sparql.html,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,endpoint offline,Name: PROV Online; Email:provonline@gmail.com,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:http://www.wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/Public_Record_Office_Victoria_Semantic_Wiki Name:PROV Online Email:provonline@gmail.com,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0,0,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,True,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.387,44.74,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline
