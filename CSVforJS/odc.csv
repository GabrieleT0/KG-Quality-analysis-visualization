Each dataset contains values for a single indicator and a single year- with one value for each of the 32484 LSOAs in England. In addition there are supporting datasets- such as the list of all LSOAs and their locations. Each dataset has a page that explains more about the data it contains and how it's organised. The English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 were released on March 24th 2011. ### Subpackages:package:odc-lsoa,http://opendatacommunities.org/,absent,0.75,[],{},nan,-,0,odc,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://opendatacommunities.org/ Name:opendatacommunities.org Email:Absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0,0,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.287,0.08,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
