It has been developed in compliance with the IFLA recommendations- and other international standards in the field of subject indexing. This tool has been created for general and specialized Italian libraries- and for museums- multimedia libraries- archives and documentation centres. The main component of the NS is a general thesaurus available on the web since 2007 (http://thes.bncf.firenze.sbn.it/ricerca.php).
