Since becoming a National Science Digital Library collection in 2004- the Rosetta Archive has more than doubled its collection size- now serving nearly 100-000 pages of material documenting over 2-500 languages—the largest resource of its kind on the Net.### Downloads  * [Rosetta Project collection at the Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/rosettaproject)  * [Rosetta Project at Freebase](http://rosetta.freebase.com/),http://www.rosettaproject.org/,absent,0.75,[],{},nan,-,0,rosettaproject,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,endpoint absent,Name: Jeff Good; Email:jcgood@buffalo.edu,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://www.rosettaproject.org/ Name:Jeff Good (lead compiler) Email:jcgood@buffalo.edu,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0,0,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,True,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.387,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent
