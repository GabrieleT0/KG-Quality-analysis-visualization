Different types of notice presently have very different degrees of mark up.> The quality of the information in the London Gazette is excellent. Content is published primarily on behalf of solicitors- government- insolvency practitioners and other known stakeholders. Accuracy is absolutely key.> Data can be made available on an ongoing basis in XML- Excel and other formats. RDFa will launch shortly for some categories.> The two files on this web page enable you to explore the content:> 1. An XML file of all published notices from mid February 2007 to end May 2008.> 2.
