DBpedia Spotlight: shedding light on the web of documents. In Proc. of the 7th Int. Conf. on Semantic Systems- 2011.It contains 60 natural language sentences from ten different New York Times articles with overall 249 annotated DBpedia entities- i. e. the entities are not explicitely bound to mentions within the texts- which causes a certain lack of clarity. Therefore- we (in all conscience) retroactively have allocated the entities to their positions within the texts.The entities dbp:Markup_Language and dbp:PBC_CSKA_Moscow could not be linked in the texts- since there was also a more specific entity enlisted occupying their solely possible location- e. g. hypertext markup language has been annotated with dbp:HTML rather than dbp:Markup_language.,Absent,False,0.5,1,0,0.001,-,3425,dbpediaspotlightnifnercorpus,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,8.134365822593948e-05,endpoint absent,"Name: Magnus Knuth; Email:magnus.knuth""at""hpi.uni-potsdam.de",endpoint absent,endpoint absent,"Web:Absent Name:Magnus Knuth Email:magnus.knuth""at""hpi.uni-potsdam.de",endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.09,325,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.329,44.73,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
