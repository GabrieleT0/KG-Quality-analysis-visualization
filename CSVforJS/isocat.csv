2022-07-18,-1,0,Creative Commons Attribution - cc-by -,-,ISOcat,ISO 12620 provides a framework for defining data categories compliant with the ISO/IEC 11179 family of standards. According to this model- each data category is assigned a unique administrative identifier- together with information on the status or decision-making process associated with the data category. In addition- data category specifications in the DCR contain linguistic descriptions- such as data category definitions- statements of associated value domains- and examples. Data category specifications can be associated with a variety of data element names and with language-specific versions of definitions- names- value domains and other attributes.The RDF dumps of different profiles are dynamically generated at query time over the https://catalog.clarin.eu/isocat/rest/profile/$x.rdf with $x being the profile number.Triple counts on May 16- 2014:3.rdf 26475.rdf 123586.rdf 44927.rdf 36610.rdf 262911.rdf 71213.rdf 5814.rdf 57215.rdf 13116.rdf 7617.rdf 14919.rdf 38320.rdf 56122.rdf 6,http://www.isocat.org,False,0.75,10,0.067,0.005,-,25000,isocat,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,0.0004647983381171535,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://www.isocat.org Name:S.E.
