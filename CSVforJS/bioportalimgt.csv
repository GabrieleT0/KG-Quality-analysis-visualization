2022-07-18,-1,0,Other (Not Open) - other-closed -,-,IMGT-ONTOLOGY,"IMGT-ONTOLOGY is the first ontology for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. It provides a semantic specification of the terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and manages the related knowledge- thus allowing the standardization for immunogenetics data from genome- proteome- genetics- two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures.IMGT-ONTOLOGY manages the knowledge through diverse facets relying on seven axioms- ""IDENTIFICATION""- ""CLASSIFICATION""- ""DESCRIPTION""- ""NUMEROTATION""- ""LOCALIZATION""- ""ORIENTATION"" and ""OBTENTION"". These axioms postulate that any object- any process and any relation can be identified- classified- described- numbered- localized and orientated- and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY- also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches- the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies- which need to identify- to classify- to describe- to number- to localize and to orientate objects- processes and relations at the molecule- cell- tissue- organ- organism or population levels.IMGT®- the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®- has been built on IMGT-ONTOLOGY.The version 1.0.1 of IMGT-ONTOLOGY- edited with Protégé (v4.2.0)- includes the concepts of IDENTIFICATION which are ""ChainType""- ""Classtype""- ""ConfigurationType""- ""EntityType""- ""FormatType""- ""FunctionalityType""- ""GeneType""- ""LevelChainType""- ""LocationType""- ""MolecularComponent""- ""MoleculeType""- ""MoleculeUnit""-  ""StructureType""- and  ""TaxonRank"".",http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1491,True,1.0,10,1.000,0.005,-,8283,bioportalimgt,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,8.426806367949842e-05,endpoint absent,Name: BioPortal project on behalf of ontology owner.; Email:support@bioontology.org,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1491 Name:Véronique Giudicelli; Patrice Duroux; Professor Marie-Paule Lefranc Email:Absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.03,209,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.351,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
