It was originally developed for a diploma thesis at the University of Leipzig. Development is continued by Wikimedia Deutschland.Note: only extracts for specific topics are available for download right now. This is due mainly to the sheer size of the dump files. Full SQL dumps are available upon request. For the next release- we plan to make full RDF dumps available again.### UpdatesThe original thesaurus was created in 2008- using data from late 2007. An update thesaurus is due to be released soon. Wikimedia Deutschland plans to release new versions on a regular basis.### LicensingThe thesaurus as such is generated automatically and thus considered to be in the public domain. It is not created from textual content- but from the structure of Wikipedia articles- and Wikipedia as a whole. No database protection rights are claimed or enforced.Some data sets may however contain concept definitions taken directly from Wikipedia - these are licensed GFDL (for newer versions- this will be CC-BY-SA 3.0)- the authorship can be determined by looking at the page history of the respective Wikipedia article.,http://brightbyte.de/page/WikiWord,absent,0.75,[],{},nan,-,0,wikiwordthesaurus,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,endpoint absent,Name: Daniel Kinzler for Wikimedia Deutschland; Email:daniel.kinzler@wikimedia.de,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://brightbyte.de/page/WikiWord Name:Daniel Kinzler Email:daniel.kinzler@wikimedia.de,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0,0,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.387,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent
