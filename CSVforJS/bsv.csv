This dataset is an open archive of PHB published after 2009.The dataset is one result of the french project untitled VESPA (Value and optimization of epidemiosurveillance devices in a sustainable crop protection strategy) leading by INRA.A PHB is an information document- both technical and regulatory in nature- written under the responsibility of a regional epidemiological surveillance committee. A PHB gathers information about the health status of crops.
