It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart- for example- is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage).
