Currently- only data from the product labels of prescription drugs and a subset of over the counter medications is provided. A powerful feature of LinkedSPLs is that all active moieties and product labels are mapped to RxNORM PURLs provided by the NCBO Bioportal SPARQL endpoint. Also- this site's SPL data is updated weekly and all SPLs retain DailyMed versioning data so that researchers can record the provenance of the text and sections they work with.
