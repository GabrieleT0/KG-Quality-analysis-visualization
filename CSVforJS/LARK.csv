2022-07-18,0,0,http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by,-,Lark,Lark is a Lexicon for Adjective Representations over Knowledge bases. It specifies how to transform adjectives in natural language questions to SPARQL query patterns over knowledge bases (currently we focus on DBpedia-202105). For example- the adjective “Chinese” in “Chinese artists” is represented as “?x dbo:nationality dbr:China”- taking the meaning that a Chinese artist should have a fact about his/her nationality with value dbr:China. The adjective “tall” in “tall people” is represented as “?x dbo:height ?y . filter (?y>V)”- taking the meaning that a tall person should have a large value of dbo:height. Currently- Lark contains about 22.4K SPARQL query patterns for 2.7K adjectives over DBpedia- in Ontolex-lemon (https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) format. All representations have been manually checked before publication. Besides- an online interface for searching adjective representations in Lark is available at http://ws.nju.edu.cn/lark/interface/ . We will enlarge Lark and consider other knowledge bases such as Freebase and Wikidata in future work.,http://ws.nju.edu.cn/adj2sp/,absent,0.75,1,0,0.001,-,145596,LARK,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://ws.nju.edu.cn/lark/sparql,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,8.500763623740793e-05,endpoint offline,Name: absent; email: yuxin.wis@gmail.com,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:http://ws.nju.edu.cn/adj2sp/ Name:Jiwei Ding Email:jwdingnju@outlook.com,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0.15,22434,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,False,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.345,44.74,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline
