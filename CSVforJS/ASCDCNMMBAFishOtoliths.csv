Originally- the metadata was established by the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA- 國立海洋生物博物館) in Taiwan (ROC). It provides information on specimens of fish otoliths collected by the NMMBA and can serve as a database for the study of fish species in the coastal waters in and around Taiwan.
