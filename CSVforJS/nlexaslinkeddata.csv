It offers a unified search form to national legislation databases- a multilingual dictionary (EUROVOC) as well as a context-sensitive help. The project started with 4 national databases and has grown to 23 databases today.Besides the unified search form (which is not very useful for extraction purposes)- the website also contains links to the respective national websites of the databases. All national databases offer a non-standardized access to their data- which in all cases is HTML or worse (e.g. PDF documents). Given the fact- that there are also no dumps of raw data (e.g. CSV) available- there is no unified N-LEX dataset that can be converted and published as Linked Data. Rather each countries legislation database has to be treated as an autonomous dataset.
