In addition- we use the Fuseki Triple Store which has a SPARQL query form available at: http://futurewavehosting.com:3030 where one would use the Control Panel and select the dataset my-family-lineage.  The website is community driven and through the import of GEDCOM files (Genealogical Data Communication) wiki pages are created- an accompanying RDF file is created and the data is added to the triple store. </p><br /><p> We use the latest GEDCOM standard version 5.5 which is used by various Genealogy software applications.  </p><p>We have a void file available at: http://my-family-lineage.com/void.ttl which provides information about vocabularies used- licensing- example resources- and link sets.  </p><p>We collect information about Places that correspond to events in an individual/person's life or in the life of a family.  It is here that there are the most triples linking to other data sets that are part of the current LOD Cloud.  Nearly 50-000 triples describe Places- of those over 7300 triples are links to external data sets- including dbpedia- geonames- freebase and yago.</p><p>We have included a great deal of information from public genealogy (GEDCOM) files including the genealogy of famous people- e.g. royalty- US Presidents- Authors like Stephen King and more. </p>",http://my-family-lineage.com/wiki/Main_Page,False,0.75,4,0.333,0.002,-,3000000,myfamilylineage,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://futurewavehosting.com:3030/my-family-lineage/sparql,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,8.248234469585415e-05,endpoint offline,Name: Bruce Whealton; Email:bruce@whealton.info,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:http://my-family-lineage.com/wiki/Main_Page Name:Bruce Whealton Email:bruce@whealton.info,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0.00,6932,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,True,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.387,44.74,-,-,endpoint offline
