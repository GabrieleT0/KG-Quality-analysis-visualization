2022-07-18,-1,0,Other (Open) - other-open -,-,Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) of the Open American National Corpus,The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) consists of approximately 500-000 words of contemporary American English written and spoken data drawn from the OPEN AMERICAN NATIONAL CORPUS (OANC).All of MASC includes manually validated annotations for sentence boundaries- token- lemma and POS; noun and verb chunks; and named entities (person- location- organization- date). Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus- including full-text annotation for FrameNet frame elements- WordNet sense tags- and Penn Treebank syntactic annotation. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects.Unlike most freely available corpora including a wide variety of linguistic annotations- MASC contains texts from a broad range of genres.MASC is an OPEN LANGUAGE DATA resource that can be downloaded by anyone for any purpose. At the same time- it is a resource that will be enhanced by the community- through its contributions of annotations and derived data.The RDF conversion from GrAF is still in preparation. Below- you can find a preliminary OWL2/DL representation of the PennTreebank syntax (60.000 tok) in OWL- generated out of the original annotations- instead.
