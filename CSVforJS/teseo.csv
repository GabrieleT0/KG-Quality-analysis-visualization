Teseo's website provides different forms to query the database- but makes it difficult for automatic processing.In order to make it openly available to anyone- we scrapped all the information of the database and stored it in a relational database model. As most of the data is not validated (form fields accept any text string)- there may be some errors related to the data- as we have automatically processed them in order to perform different analyses. Should you detect any error- you can find different ways to contact us on the about section.Linked Open Data: All the information is also publicly published as Linked Open Data- and queryable through the dedicated 4 million triples). http://apps.morelab.deusto.es/teseo/,Absent,absent,0.5,[],{},nan,-,0,teseo,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://apps.morelab.deusto.es/teseo/sparql,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:Absent Name:Aitor Almeida Email:aitor.almeida@deusto.es,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0,0,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,True,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.325,44.73,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline
